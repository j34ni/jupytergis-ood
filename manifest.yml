        This app will launch JupyterGIS on Fox.

        JupyterGIS combines Jupyter notebooks with the capabilities normally offered by a GIS (Geographic Information System).
       
        It also comes with a feature called RTC (Real-Time Collaboration) for multiple users to simultaneously work on the same code. 
        
        Perform geospatial analysis and visualize geographic data interactively with colleagues.
